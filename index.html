<h3>About Me<h3>
<p>Ive been riding to school ever since elementary, I played soccer for 9-10 years and Im planning to play all 4 years of high school.  After high school Im planning on going to college before i get a full time job.  After college i don't know what job i want to do yet.  I dont think that I will get a scholarship for soccer but If I do then that would be really good for me.  If I dont get a scholarship for soccer I will most likely stop playing soccer.<p>

<p>If anyone actually read all the way up to this part. Why are you still here??? The last paragraph was the last part of the assignment.  Are you still reading this??? Just stop theres nothing else after this, do something better than reading a pointless paragraph.  Seriously though stop reading this your just wasting your time, I know you have something else to do so why are you still reading.  Just play a game or something to keep you from reading this, stop reading already.  JUST STOP READING IVE TOLD YOU THIS TOO MUCH ALREADY JUST LISTEN PLEASE! If you are still reading this then good job, you wasted even more time reading this.<p>
